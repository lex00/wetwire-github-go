I need help setting up CI/CD for my Go web application.

I want to:
- Build and test my code automatically
- Test on different Go versions (1.23 and 1.24)
- Test on Ubuntu and macOS
- Deploy to staging when I push to main
- Deploy to production with manual approval

I also need:
- A test job that runs with coverage
- A linter check
- Deployment jobs that only run after build and test pass

Can you create the workflow files for me?
