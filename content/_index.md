Generate GitHub Actions workflows from Go structs with AI-assisted design.

## Philosophy

Wetwire uses typed constraints to reduce the model capability required for accurate code generation.

**Core hypothesis:** Typed input + smaller model ≈ Semantic input + larger model

The type system and lint rules act as a force multiplier — cheaper models produce quality output when guided by schema-generated types and iterative lint feedback.
